# Word-Guess-Game

Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.

key-up function
use IDs to autopopulate information
need arrays for the words I want to use 

Display the following on the page:

Press any key to get started!
Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).



If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _  _ a.



Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.


theme: colorado

words: rockies, skiing, mountains, hiking, biking, sunny, west, microbrewiers, outdoors

things I still need to accomplish:

1. adding all the letters to a new array and then removing the guessed letters 
2. replacing the underline with the right letter - maybe look into indexOf functions for this to know the right spots
3. showing all wrong guessed letter (not just last pressed)
4. removing the commas inbetween the inidivdual lines
5. have a winning count for if you get the whole word right
6. move onto the next word
